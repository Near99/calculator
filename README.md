# Mini Calculator Project from The Odin Project

After spending a couple of hours on this project I found to write a calculator is much more complicated than I thought, and It's beyound my capability.
So I just kept it simple and did a simple one.
+/- it's not available for use.
Didn't do keydown feature as well.
These features are just a matter of time and I have no intention to do that now.
My javascript is quite limited and will only make the code even more ugly if continue adding features.
Gonna move forward and will (maybe) come back to make a powerful, fully functioning calculator.
